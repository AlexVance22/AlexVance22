## Who Am I
This used to be my C/C++ github account, but in recent months I've made a big push to get comfortable with rust, and I'm gonna be uploading lots of that in future.

## My Various Pages
- I have a [blog](www.alexscodeblog.com), though the domain is inactive at the moment.
- I also have a very non-code related [YouTube channel](www.youtube.com/@lookingformadrid).
