# Hey, It's me Alex
***
## Who Am I
- C/C++/Rust enthusiast
- Python/Lua on weekends
- I like producing my own command line tools and experimenting with graphics
- I abuse game frameworks to produce desktop GUIs because standard tools in systems languages are miserable
- Obligatory "I use NeoVim btw" shoutout
- Also hoping to learn a bit of web dev soon, still trying to figure out how it all works (experimenting with Express, React, Next, Vite etc)

## My Various Pages
- I have a [blog](https://www.alexscodeblog.com), where you can sometimes find me documenting my process for creating these projects, among other ramblings about various artistic projects.
- I also have a very non-code related [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@lookingformadrid).
